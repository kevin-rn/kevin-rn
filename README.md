### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kevin, a MSc Computer Science graduate from TU Delft. With a growth-oriented mindset and a passion for all things big data science related, I am constantly driven to seek out
new knowledge and remain at the forefront of technological advancements.

**Master Thesis:** *Efficient Fact-checking through Supporting Fact Extraction from Large Data Collections* ([code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/Efficient-Fact-checking)|[paper](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A990b1567-7c6e-43a1-9832-3d5a9a53c41a))    
Make use of various methods for identifying and indexing supporting facts and enhancing the retrieval phase of the fact-checking pipeline.

**Bachelor Thesis:** *Creating a TPM based smart contract for the Medical Supply Chain in Hyperledger Fabric* ([code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/medical-supply)|[paper](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A5def242c-0440-4601-bb0e-34e62343d81b))  
Incorporating cryptographic functionalities of TPM 2.0 to provide security in the use of smart contracts used in a blockchain applications (open-source Hyperledger Fabric was used).

**Noteworthy projects:**

  â€¢	Software project for Netcompany building a custom information retrieval system using Spring Boot, Elasticsearch and Vue.js. Due to NDA I'm not allowed to share this.
  
  â€¢	Evaluating Java-Python code translation by fine-tuning two Language models (CodeBERT and PLBART) on a scraped and generated dataset (Rosetta Code, Sample Programs, CodingBat, A problem solved in 22 programming languages and LeetCode) and evaluate these fine-tuned models on two metrics, namely Bleu-4 and xMatch. The evaluation and fine-tuning of the models has been adapted from CodeXGLUE and the preprocessing of the data is done by AVATAR. [code](https://github.com/ML4SE2022/group3)
  
  â€¢	Developing Scalable Services and Managing their Transactions with CockroachDB and testing these using Kubernetes [code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/Web-Scale-Data-Management)
  
  â€¢	Modular Intrusion Prevention System, similar to fail2ban, which monitors and stores (SQLAlchemy) failed authentication logs from applications such as Joomla and Wordpress and temporarily blocks traffic from IP-addresses that exceed a configurable number of attempts. [code](
  
  â€¢	Mutual Inconsistency Detection In Distributed Systems using akka to ensure copies of documents between â€˜actorsâ€™ remain concistent. [code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/Mutual-Inconsistency-Detection-In-Distributed-Systems)
  
  â€¢	Extracting and storing webpage cookies as to verify whether these accommodate the General Data Protection Regulation. [code](https://github.com/ptemarvelde/gdpr_cookies)
  
  â€¢	A mock user interface of Instagram UI using Python-based web framework Django as to propose an alternative recommendation system architecture that may benefit the users among other stakeholders. [code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/Instagram-Alternative-Recommendation)
  
  â€¢	Java Application tracking green activites of a user with features like having a ranking system between users. [code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/GoGreen)

  â€¢	Develop a full raytracer that generates static images from a virtual scene containing lights, objects and a camera. [code](https://github.com/kevin-rn/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/Raytracer)
